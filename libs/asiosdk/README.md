## Introduction


Audio Stream Input/Output (ASIO) fulfills the requirements of professional audio recording and playback by supporting variable bit depths and sample rates, multi-channel operation, and synchronization. This ensures low latency, high performance, straightforward setup, and stable audio recording for the user.  

The entire system becomes controllable and offers complete and immediate access to the audio system's capabilities. Since its introduction, ASIO has become a supported standard by leading audio hardware manufacturers.

## Dual Licensing

Developers can choose between two options: 
 - Use of the **proprietary ASIO SDK license**, for use cases that benefit from closed-source licensing.
 - Adopt the [General Public License (GPL) Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) for full open-source integration.

Both options grant access to the same SDK.

## Trademark and Logo Usage 

### General Principle 

Trademark usage (e.g. "**ASIO**" name or logo) is optional under [GPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), but, if used, must comply with Steinberg's official trademark rules, just like under the proprietary license.

### Permitted Use (if selected) 

If you choose to use the **ASIO** Compatible Logo or refer to the **ASIO** trademark under either license: 

- Logos must be used in unaltered form.
- Use must follow the official usage guidelines provided in the SDK.
- The trademark/logo must appear only in clear product-related contexts, such as: 
    - Splash screens 
    - About boxes 
    - Product websites 
    - Documentation and manuals 

This ensures legal compliance and brand consistency. 

### Prohibited Use 

- Using “ASIO” (or derivatives like “ASIOi”) in company or product names.
- Applying the logo or trademark to non-ASIO-compatible products.
- Associating the trademark with offensive, obscene, or inappropriate content.

---
### ASIO trademark and/or ASIO Compatible Logo 

(Applies If Trademark or Logo Is Used — **GPLv3** or **Proprietary**) 

If you choose to display the **ASIO** trademark and/or **ASIO Compatible Logo**, you must observe the *Steinberg ASIO Usage Guidelines*. 

*Purpose*: To assist Steinberg in enforcing and protecting the **ASIO** trademark in international jurisdictions.


### Notes for Open-Source Developers 

- The *Steinberg ASIO Usage Guidelines* are included in the SDK.
- Use of branding is not required under [GPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), but if you choose to use it, trademark compliance is mandatory.
- Non-compliance with logo guidelines does not affect your **GPLv3** rights (but may result in trademark violations).

### Best Practice Recommendation 

Although optional, we encourage developers using **ASIO** under [GPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) to follow the *Steinberg ASIO Usage Guidelines*: 

It fosters ecosystem-wide recognition, improves end-user trust, and supports the long-term visibility of the **ASIO** brand.
